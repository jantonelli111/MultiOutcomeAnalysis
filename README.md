### Multiple outcomes analysis

There are two main files in this repository. The first is MainFunctions.R, which simply has the function we wrote to perform all analyses on the final data set. The other main file is MainAnalysis.R, which reads in the data, does some cleaning and manipulating of the data to prepare it for the main function we wrote, and then analyzes the data. At the end it saves the relevant output. 

One other thing to note is that I saved the fake data that Michelle created in the folder titled Data. This data is somewhat different than what was sent to me, because the original fake data file only had data from one year. I appended multiple copies of the original data together and assigned different year values so that it more closely matches the final data set we will analyze. Otherwise it is the same.
